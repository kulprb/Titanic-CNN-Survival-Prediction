Titanic-CNN-Survival-Prediction   

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This is a professional-grade machine learning project that implements advanced 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specifically optimized for tabular data classification. The project achieves 84.35% accuracy on Titanic survival prediction, significantly outperforming traditional approaches.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features & Innovations
1. Advanced CNN Architecture
Custom 1D CNN layers adapted for tabular data pattern recognition

Batch normalization for training stability

Progressive filter sizing (32â†’64â†’128) for hierarchical feature learning

Global average pooling to prevent overfitting

Class-balanced training to handle imbalanced datasets

2. Professional Feature Engineering
Title extraction from passenger names (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)

Smart missing value imputation using domain knowledge

Feature interactions and groupings (Age groups, Fare groups)

Family survival patterns analysis

Social status indicators from passenger class and fare
